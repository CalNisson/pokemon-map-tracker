# Pok√©mon Tracker
[Website Project](https://sekii.gitlab.io/pokemon-tracker) - [Old Website Project](https://sekii.gitlab.io/emerald-warp-tracker/)

Project open to public so feel free to fork or add new maps for other game gens. If you do programming work to modify the code, there's a high chance I won't accept it, specially if it end ups adding more dependencies to it.

On the "games" folder you can check some of the already existing games to see what is needed to add other generations of games.
